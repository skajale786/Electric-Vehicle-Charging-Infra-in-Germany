# Electric-Vehicle-Charging-Infra-in-Germany
Is it smart to buy an e-car when you live in Germany?

### Motivation
Electric cars, also known as e-cars, have gradually gained popularity in Germany over the past few years due to a number of incentives provided by the government. Germany is one of the leading countries in Europe for e-car sales and is moving towards developing sustainable transportation. The government has been providing various subsidies, such as tax incentives, for e-car buyers in order to boost adoption. As a result, consumer demand for electric cars is on the rise in Germany, with Tesla being one of the most popular electric vehicle brands in the country. Additionally, major German car manufacturers such as Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, are investing in the development of electric vehicles to match the increasing demand for sustainable mobility.

But does Germany have the infrastructure to efficiently charge the growing number of electronic cars?
